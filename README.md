# Overview

This is one of my first programming projects ever. It is an extremely simple desktop application with a login and sign up system. It was written in Python with the `PySide6` GUI library. The project utilizes a virtual environment (.venv) running `Python 3.11.5` and `Pip` to manage libraries.
